//============================ coins =================================
//Out of 8 coins, one weighs less than the others. You have a scale.
//How can you determine which one weighs less in 2 weigh? *


//step 1 .at first we separate 8 coins within 3 part(3, 3, 2);
//then we weight 3 and 3,
//step 2. if there is equal we weight other two coins , so we  find out lighter.
//if first three coins not equal each other, we again weight lighter part with cutting 2 part, and if not equal,
//take lighter part and do it one more time, finally we find lighter coin.
